Titanic Data Analysis
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore patterns in passenger survival. It covers univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using statistical summaries and visualizations.

Key Steps
Data Exploration – Checked data types, missing values, and summary statistics.

Univariate Analysis – Examined individual features (e.g., age, fare, sex) using histograms and count plots.

Bivariate Analysis – Explored relationships between features (e.g., sex vs. survival, class vs. fare).

Multivariate Analysis – Combined multiple variables to identify complex survival patterns.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization

Insights
Females had a higher survival rate than males.

Passengers in 1st class had better survival odds.

Younger passengers tended to survive more often.
